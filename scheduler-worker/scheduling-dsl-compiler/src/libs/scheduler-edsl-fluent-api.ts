   *
   * #### Inputs
   * - **goals**: an ordered list of goals (here below referenced as the subgoals)
   *
   * #### Behavior
   * The scheduler will try to satisfy each subgoal in the list. If a subgoal is only partially satisfied, the scheduler will not backtrack and will let the inserted activities in the plan. If all the subgoals are satisfied, the AND goal will appear satisfied. If one or several subgoals have not been satisfied, the AND goal will appear unsatisfied.
   *
   * #### Examples
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
   *       forEach: Real.Resource("/fruit").equal(4.0),

The second goal will place 10 occurrences of the same kind of activities `PeelBanana`. The first subgoal will be evaluated first and will place a certain number of `PeelBanana` activities in the plan. When the second goal will be evaluated, it will count already present `PeelBanana` activities and insert the missing number. Imagine the first goals leads to inserting 2 activities. The second goal will then have to place 8 activities to be satisfied.

   * The scheduler will try to satisfy each subgoal in the list until one is satisfied. If a subgoal is only partially satisfied, the scheduler will not backtrack and will let the inserted activities in the plan.

   *
   * It may fail to achieve both subgoals but as the scheduler does not backtrack for now, activities inserted by any of the subgoals are kept in the plan.

  /**
   * Restricts the windows on which a goal is applied
   *
   *
   * By default, a goal applies on the whole planning horizon. The Aerie scheduler provides support for restricting _when_ a goal applies with the `.applyWhen()` method in the `Goal` class. This node allows users to provide a set of windows (`Windows`, see [documentation](../../constraints-edsl-api/classes/Windows)) which could be a time or a resource-based window.
   *
   * The `.applyWhen()` method, takes one argument: the windows (in the form of an expression) that the goal should apply over. What follows is an example that applies a daily recurrence goal only when a given resource is greater than 2. If the resource is less than two, then the goal is no longer applied.
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
   *             activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 })
   *           }),
   *           interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 })
   *         }).applyWhen(Real.Resource("/fruit").greaterThan(2))
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * #### Notes on boundaries:
   * * If you are trying to schedule an activity, or a recurrence within a window but that window cuts off either the activity or the recurrence interval (depending on the goal type), it will not be scheduled. For example, if you had a recurrence interval of 3 seconds, scheduling a 2 second activity each recurrence, and had the following window, you'd get the following:
   * ```
   * Recurrence interval: [++-++-++-]
   * Goal window:         [+++++----]
   * Result:              [++-------]
   * ```
   * That, is, the second activity won't be scheduled as the goal window cuts off its recurrence interval.
   * * Scheduling is _local_, not global. This means for every window that is matched (as it is possible to have disjoint windows, imagine a resource that fluctuates upward and downward but only applying that goal when the resource is over a certain value), the goal is applied individually. So, for that same recurrence interval setup as before, we could have:
   * ```
   * Recurrence interval: [++-++-++-++-]
   * Goal window:         [+++++--+++--]
   * Result:              [++-----++---] //(the second one is applied independently of the first!)
   * ```
   * * When mapping out a temporal window to apply a goal over, keep in mind that the ending boundary of the goal is _exclusive_, i.e. if I want to apply a goal in the window of 10-12 seconds, it will apply only on seconds 10 and 11. This is in line with the [fencepost problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error).
   *
   * @param windows the windows on which this goal applies
   * @returns a new goal applying on a restricted horizon
   */

  /**
   * Creates an ActivityRecurrenceGoal
   *
   * The Activity Recurrence Goal (sometimes referred to as a "frequency goal") specifies that a certain activity should occur repeatedly throughout the plan, at some given interval.
   *
   * #### Inputs
   * - activityTemplate: the description of the activity whose recurrence we're interested in.
   * - activityFinder: an optional activity expression. If present, it will be used as replacement of activityTemplate to match against existing activities in the plan.
   * - interval: a Duration of time specifying how often this activity must occur
   *
   * #### Behavior
   * This interval is treated as an upper bound - so if the activity occurs more frequently, that is not considered a failure.
   *
   * The scheduler will find places in the plan where the given activity has not occurred within the given interval, and it will place an instance of that activity there.
   *
   * > Note: The interval is measured between the _start times_ of two activity instances. Neither the duration, nor the end time of the activity are examined by this goal.
   *
   * #### Example
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
   *             activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 })
   *           }),
   *           interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 })
   *         })
   * }
   *
   * The goal above will place a `GrowBanana` activity in every 2-hour period of time that does not already contain one with the exact same parameters.
   *
   * ```
   * #### With an activityFinder
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.ActivityRecurrenceGoal({
   *             activityFinder: ActivityExpression.build(ActivityTypes.GrowBanana, {growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({hours : 1})})
   *             activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1 })
   *           }),
   *           interval: Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 2 })
   *         })
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Same behavior as above but in this last example, an activity finder is used to match against existing activities in the plan that would satisfy the goal. Here, any GrowBanana activity with a `growingDuration` parameter equal to `Temporal.Duration.from({hours : 1})` would match, disregarding the value of the other parameter `quantity`.

  /**
   * Creates a coexistence goal. The coexistence goal places one activity for each passed window.
   * The start and end time of each activity can be parametrized relatively to its coexisting window with temporal constraints.
   *
   * The Coexistence Goal specifies that a certain activity should occur once **for each** occurrence of some condition.
   *
   * #### Inputs
   * - **forEach**: a set of time windows (`Windows`, see [documentation](../../constraints-edsl-api/classes/Windows) on how to produce such an expression) or a set of activities (`ActivityExpression`) or an Interval or a Temporal.Instant
   * - **activityTemplate**: the description of the activity to insert after each activity identified by `forEach`. If activityFinder is not defined, used for both matching against existing activities and creating new ones.
   * - **activityFinder: an optional activity expression. If present, it will be used as replacement of activityTemplate to match against existing activities in the plan.
   * - **startsAt**: optionally specify a specific time when the activity should start relative to the window
   * - **startsWithin**: optionally specify a range when the activity should start relative to the window
   * - **endsAt**: optionally specify a specific time when the activity should end relative to the window
   * - **endsWithin**: optionally specify a range when the activity should end relative to the window
   *
   * NOTE: Either the start or end of the activity must be constrained. This means that at least **1** of the 4 properties `startsAt`, `startsWithin`, `endsAt`, `endsWithin` must be given.
   *
   *
   * #### Behavior
   * The scheduler will find places in the plan where the `forEach` condition is true, find if an activity matching either the activity template or activity finder is present and if not, it will insert a new instance using the given `activityTemplate` and temporal constraints.
   *
   * #### Examples
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default () => Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
   *   forEach: ActivityExpression.ofType(ActivityTypes.GrowBanana),
   *   activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({peelDirection: "fromStem"}),
   *   startsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 }))
   * })
   * ```
   * Behavior: for each activity A of type `GrowBanana` present in the plan when the goal is evaluated, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` starting exactly at the end of A + 5 minutes.
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default () => Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
   *   forEach: ActivityExpression.ofType(ActivityTypes.GrowBanana),
   *   activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({peelDirection: "fromStem"}),
   *   startsWithin: TimingConstraint.range(WindowProperty.END, Operator.PLUS, Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 })),
   *   endsWithin: TimingConstraint.range(WindowProperty.END, Operator.PLUS, Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 6 }))
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * Behavior: for each activity A of type `GrowBanana` present in the plan when the goal is evaluated, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` starting in the interval [end of A, end of A + 5 minutes] and ending in the interval [end of A, end of A + 6 minutes].
   *
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default () => Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
   *   forEach: Real.Resource("/fruit").equal(4.0),
   *   activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({peelDirection: "fromStem"}),
   *   endsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 }))
   * })
   * ```
   * Behavior: for each continuous period of time during which the `/fruit` resource is equal to 4, place an activity of type `PeelBanana` ending exactly at the end of A + 6 minutes. Note that the scheduler will allow a default timing error of 500 milliseconds for temporal constraints. This parameter will be configurable in an upcoming release.
   *
   * KNOWN ISSUE: If the end is unconstrained while the activity has an uncontrollable duration, the scheduler may fail to place the activity. To work around this, add an `endsWithin` constraint that encompasses your expectation for the duration of the activity - this will help the scheduler narrow the search space.
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default () => Goal.CoexistenceGoal({
   *   forEach: Real.Resource("/fruit").equal(4.0),
   *   activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.PeelBanana({peelDirection: "fromStem"}),
   *   activityFinder: ActivityExpression.ofType(ActivityTypes.PeelBanana)
   *   endsAt: TimingConstraint.singleton(WindowProperty.END).plus(Temporal.Duration.from({ minutes: 5 }))
   * })
   * ```
   * Behavior: Same as above but the activity finder is being used to match against any existing PeelBanana activity in the plan, disregarding the value of its parameters.

  /**
   * The Cardinality Goal specifies that a certain activity should occur in the plan either a certain number of times, or for a certain total duration.
   * #### Inputs
   * - **activityTemplate**: the description of the activity whose recurrence we're interested in. If activityFinder is not defined, used for both matching against existing activities and creating new ones.
   * - **activityFinder: an optional activity expression. If present, it will be used as replacement of activityTemplate to match against existing activities in the plan.
   * - **specification**: an object with either an `occurrence` field, a `duration` field, or both (see examples below).
   * #### Behavior
   * The duration and occurrence are treated as lower bounds - so if the activity occurs more times, or for a longer duration, that is not considered a failure, and the scheduler will not add any more activities.
   *
   * The scheduler will identify whether it not the plan has enough occurrences or total duration of the given activity template. If not, it will add activities until satisfaction.
   *
   * #### Examples
   *
   * Setting a lower bound on the total duration:
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
   *         activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
   *         }),
   *         specification: { duration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 10 }) }
   *     })
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Setting a lower bound on the number of occurrences:
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
   *         activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
   *         }),
   *         specification: { occurrence: 10 }
   *     })
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Combining the two:
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
   *         activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
   *             growingDuration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 1 }),
   *         }),
   *         specification: { occurrence: 10, duration: Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: 10 }) }
   *     })
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * With an activity finder:
   *
   * ```typescript
   * export default function myGoal() {
   *     return Goal.CardinalityGoal({
   *         activityTemplate: ActivityTemplates.GrowBanana({
   *             quantity: 1,
