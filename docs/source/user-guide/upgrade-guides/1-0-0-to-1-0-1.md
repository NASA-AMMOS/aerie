# 1.0.0 to 1.0.1

This document describes the upgrade instructions from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.

## Use a Record Instead of a Pair for Profile Segments ([#434](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/434))

Java clients of `SimulationResults` will need to be updated to use `ProfileSegment::extent` and `ProfileSegment::dynamics` instead of `Pair::getLeft` and `Pair::getRight`. Please see the changes in [the PR](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie/pull/434/files) for examples.
