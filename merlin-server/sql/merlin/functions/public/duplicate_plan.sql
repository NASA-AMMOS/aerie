comment on function duplicate_plan(plan_id integer, new_plan_name text, new_owner integer) is e''
  'Copies all of a given plan''s properties and activities into a new plan with the specified name.
  When duplicating a plan, a snapshot is created of the original plan.
  Additionally, that snapshot becomes the latest snapshot of the new plan.';
