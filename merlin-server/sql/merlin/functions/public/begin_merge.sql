/*
  Plans are merged following a three way merge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Three-way_merge)
  algorithm. After beginning a merge, the activities will be placed into one of two areas:
  a Merge Staging Area (MSA) and a Conflicting Activities table (CA).

  Where they will go is decided as follows:

  Difference btwn Source and MB | Difference btwn Target and MB | Outcome
  ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------
            Add                 |             --                | Into MSA as Add
            --                  |             Add               | Into MSA as None
            None                |             None              | Into MSA as None
            Modify              |             None              | Into MSA as Modify
            Delete              |             None              | Into MSA as Delete
            None                |             Modify            | Into MSA as None
            Modify (Equal)      |             Modify (Equal)    | Into MSA as None
            Modify (Inequal)    |             Modify (Inequal)  | Into CA
            Delete              |             Modify            | Into CA
            None                |             Delete            | Dropped
