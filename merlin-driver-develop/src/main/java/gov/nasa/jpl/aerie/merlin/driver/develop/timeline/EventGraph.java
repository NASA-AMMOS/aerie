/**
 * An immutable tree-representation of a graph of sequentially- and concurrently-composed events.
 *
 * <p>
 * An event graph is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series-parallel_graph">series-parallel graph</a>
 * whose edges represent atomic events. Event graphs may be composed sequentially (in series) or concurrently (in
 * parallel).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As with many recursive tree-like structures, an event graph is utilized by accepting an {@link EffectTrait} visitor
 * and traversing the series-parallel structure recursively. This trait provides methods for each type of node in the
 * tree representation (empty, sequential composition, and parallel composition). For each node, the trait combines
 * the results from its children into a result that will be provided to the same trait at the node's parent. The result
 * of the traversal is the value computed by the trait at the root node.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Different domains may interpret each event differently, and so evaluate the same event graph under different
 * projections. An event may have no particular effect in one domain, while being critically important to another
 * domain.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <Event> The type of event to be stored in the graph structure.
 * @see EffectTrait
