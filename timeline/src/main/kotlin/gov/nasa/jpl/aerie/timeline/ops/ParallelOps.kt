   * [(DOC)][reduceIntoProfile] Converts the payload objects into segments and combines them into a serial profile.
   *
   * After the payload objects are converted into segments, any overlapping segments are resolved by combining them
   * with a binary operation similar to a reduce operation (as in functional programming). It is recommended to
   * create the binary operation using the [NullBinaryOperation.reduce] function.
   *
   * ## Example
   *
   * Say you have a timeline of activity instances, each with an integer argument called `count`,
   * and you want to extract a profile of the `count` arguments - but in the event that the activities overlap,
   * you want to add the counts together. Your code would look like this:
   *
   * ```
   * myInstances.reduceIntoProfile(Numbers::new, BinaryOperation.reduce(
   *    (activity) -> activity.inner.count, // convert
   *    (acc, activity) -> acc + activity.inner.count // combine
   * ))
   * ```
   *
   * If the plan has three relevant activities overlapping (A, B, and C):
   * - first the converter will be called on A, starting the accumulator (`acc`)
   * - then the combiner will be called for `acc` and B, updating the accumulator
   * - then the combiner will be called for `acc` and C, etc
   *
   * If the plan also has other relevant activities the overlap sometime else,
   * they will be combined independently of A, B, and C.
   *
   * @param ctor the constructor of the result profile
   * @param op a binary operation for converting and combining the input objects
