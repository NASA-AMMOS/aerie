/**
 * An interface to the driver during model instantiation.
 *
 * <p> An {@code Initializer} allows models to {@linkplain #allocate(Object, CellType, Function, Topic) allocate}
 * storage for simulation-aware state, which is the only mutable state that can safely be shared among
 * stateful cells that can be read and updated from {@link Task}s. The model must not interact with an {@code Initializer}
 * beyond the scope in which it was received. </p>
 *
 * <p> Models can also export resources (time-varying values) and topics (streams of discrete events) via this interface.
 * These observable outputs of the model provide feedback to users, displaying the effect on the model of the input
 * directives and configuration. Observing the behavior of resources and topics is very nearly the whole point of
 * simulating a model, so it is essential to register these outputs for clients to make use of. </p>
 *
 * <p> In a future revision of this API, exportation of resources and topics may be moved to the {@link gov.nasa.jpl.aerie.merlin.protocol.model.ModelType}
 * interface, so that the existence and shape of these outputs cannot vary with model configuration. </p>
