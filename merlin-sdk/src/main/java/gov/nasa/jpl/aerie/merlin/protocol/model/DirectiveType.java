/**
 * A type of directive that can be issued to a Merlin model.
 *
 * <p> A <i>directive</i> is a means by which a model's environment can influence the model's behavior. For instance, a
 * space relay system might normally take no autonomous actions of its own; instead, it waits until it receives a
 * request to store and forward a given payload to another node in the system. </p>
 *
 * <p> A directive can be instantiated using its associated {@link InputType}, and its associated behavior can be
 * extracted using the {@link #createTask(Model, Arguments)} method. When the directive's behavior is finished, its
 * result value can be manipulated using its associated {@link OutputType}. </p>
 *
 * <p> As a reflective interface, {@code DirectiveType} is analogous to {@link java.lang.reflect.Method}. It represents
 * an executable method on a {@code Model} receiver with an {@code Arguments} input and a {@code Result} output. </p>
 *
 * @param <Model>
 *   The model that can be influenced by this directive.
 * @param <Arguments>
 *   The type of the arguments to the directive.
 * @param <Result>
 *   The result of performing the directive to completion.
