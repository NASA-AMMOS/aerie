/**
 * A signed measure of the temporal distance between two instants.
 *
 * <p>
 * Durations are constructed by measuring a quantity of the provided units, such as {@link #SECOND} and {@link #HOUR}.
 * This can be done in multiple ways:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   Use the static factory method {@link Duration#of}, e.g. {@code Duration.of(5, SECONDS}
 *
 * <li>
 *   Use the static function {@link #duration}, e.g. {@code duration(5, SECONDS)}
 *
 * <li>
 *   Multiply an existing duration by a quantity, e.g. {@code SECOND.times(5)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Durations are internally represented as a fixed-point data type. The fixed-point representation preserves
 * accuracy unlike floating-point arithmetic, which becomes less precise further from zero. Preserving accuracy is
 * necessary in the domain of discrete event simulation. To ensure that causal/temporal orderings between timed
 * elements in a simulation are preserved, it is necessary that operations on time quantities are exact. Arithmetic
 * between fixed-point representations preserves such temporal orderings.</p>
 *
 * <p>The internal fixed-point representation of a Duration is a {@code long}. This representation is evident in
 * the API where creating Durations and performing arithmetic operations often take a {@code long} as a parameter.
 * As a result, any custom unit such as {@code DAY = duration(24, HOURS)} can be used directly with other
 * Merlin-provided units like {@code SECONDS}.</p>
 *
 * <p>A time value is represented as a {@code long} where an increment maps to number a specific time unit. Currently,
 * the underlying time unit is microseconds, however, one should not rely on this always being the case. The Duration type
 * restricts this {@code long} to a range from half of long-min to half of long-max.
 * This yields a range of -2^62 to 2^62, or about 146,000 years in the future and past, at microsecond
 * resolution.</p>

 * <p>
 * Note that derived units such as DAY, WEEK, MONTH, and YEAR are <em>not</em> included, because their values
 * depend on properties of the particular calendrical system in use. For example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   The notion of "day" depends on the astronomical system against which time is measured.
 *   For example, the synodic (solar) day and the sidereal day are distinguished by which celestial body is held fixed
 *   in the sky by the passage of a day. (Synodic time fixes the body being orbited around; sidereal time
 *   fixes the far field of stars.)
 *
 * <li>
 *   The notion of "year" has precisely the same problem, with a similar synodic/sidereal distinction.
 *
 * <li>
 *   <p>
 *   The notion of "month" is worse, in that it depends on the presence of a *tertiary* body whose sygyzies with the
 *   other two bodies delimit integer quantities of the unit. (A syzygy is a collinear configuration of the bodies.)
 *   The lunar calendar (traditionally used in China) is based on a combination of lunar and solar
 *   synodic quantities. ("Month" derives from "moon".)
 *   </p>
 *
 *   <p>
 *   The month of the Gregorian calendar is approximately a lunar synodic month, except that the definition was
 *   intentionally de-regularized (including intercalary days) in deference to the Earth's solar year.
 *   (Other calendars even invoke days *outside of any month*, which Wikipedia claims are called "epagomenal days".)
 *   In retrospect, it is unsurprising that ISO 8601 ordinal dates drop the month altogether,
 *   since "month" is a (complicated) derived notion in the Gregorian calendar.
 *   </p>
 *
 * <li>
 *   The notion of "week" seemingly has no basis in the symmetries of celestial bodies, and is instead a derived unit.
 *   Unfortunately, not only is it fundamentally based on the notion of "day", different calendars assign a different
 *   number of days to the span of a week.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you are working within the Gregorian calendar, the standard `java.time` package has you covered.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you are working with spacecraft, you may need to separate concepts such as "Earth day" and "Martian day", which
 * are synodic periods measured against the Sun but from different bodies. Worse, you likely need to convert between
 * such reference systems frequently, with a great deal of latitude in the choice of bodies being referenced.
 * The gold standard is the well-known SPICE toolkit, coupled with a good set of ephemerides and clock kernels.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you're just looking for a rough estimate, you can define 24-hour days and 7-day weeks and 30-day months
 * within your own domain in terms of the precise units we give here.
 * </p>
