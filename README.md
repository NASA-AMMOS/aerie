Aerie is a software framework for modeling spacecraft. Its main features include:

- A Java-based mission modeling library
- A discrete-event simulator
- An embedded TypeScript DSL for defining and executing scheduling goals
- An embedded TypeScript DSL for defining and executing constraints
- An embedded TypeScript DSL for defining and executing activity command expansions
- An embedded TypeScript DSL for defining sequences
- A [GraphQL API](https://nasa-ammos.github.io/aerie-docs/api/introduction)
- A web-based [client application][ui-repo]

## Getting Started

To get started using Aerie for the first time please do our [fast track tutorial][fast-track] on our documentation website.
