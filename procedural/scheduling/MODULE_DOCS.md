# Module Scheduling

This library provides tools for creating scheduling procedures, based on the timeline library.
To write a procedure, create a class that implements the Procedure interface.
Then, follow the tutorial documentation (TODO: link to tutorial documentation once written)
to package and upload your constraint to Aerie.

# Package gov.nasa.ammos.aerie.procedural.scheduling
The top-level procedure types.

# Package gov.nasa.ammos.aerie.procedural.scheduling.plan
Contains the EditablePlan interface that procedure execution environments need to
implement.

# Package gov.nasa.ammos.aerie.procedural.scheduling.simulation
Contains configuration options for spawning simulations.

# Package gov.nasa.ammos.aerie.procedural.scheduling.annotations
Annotations for serializing and deserializing procedure arguments.
