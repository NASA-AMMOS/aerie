# Procedural post-simulation libraries

This subproject holds the libraries provided to the users for procedural scheduling / constraints / conditions.

## Documentation

To generate the unified docs, run `./gradlew dokkaHtmlMultiModule`. It will be available in `procedural/build/dokka/htmlMultiModule/index.html`. To view it locally, you'll need a static file server to avoid CORS problems. In IntelliJ, you can right-click on `index.html` and select `Open In -> Browser -> ...` and this will start a server for you.
