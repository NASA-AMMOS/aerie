  /**

   * This doesn't actually execute the operation, it just creates a [BaseTimeline] object that holds
   * the operation for lazy evaluation later, when [collect] is called. It then wraps the base timeline in
   * the provided constructor (called specialization) and coalesces the timeline if applicable.
   *
   * ## Safety
   *
   * This function is unsafe because all timeline types have mathematical invariants, such as ordered segments
   * for profiles, and this method allows those invariants to be broken if the user is not careful.
   * In particular, all timelines assume the result of [collect] will be contained in the `bounds` argument.
   * These invariants are often maintained automatically, but you should never assume. Violating them is UB.
   * Use at your own risk.

   * @param ctor the constructor of the new timeline type
   * @param f a function which, given this and a [CollectOptions] object, produces a list of payload objects
   *          contained in the bounds. In Java, this is a two-argument function which takes a timeline object
   *          and [CollectOptions]. In Kotlin, this is a one-argument function of the options with a timeline receiver.
   *          (see [the kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#instantiating-a-function-type))
